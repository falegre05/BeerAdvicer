# Pellet-android

An Android port of the semantic reasoner Pellet 2.3.1 http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/

Pellet is an OWL 2 reasoner. Pellet provides standard and cutting-edge reasoning services for OWL ontologies.

For applications that need to represent and reason about information using OWL, Pellet is the leading choice for systems where sound-and-complete OWL DL reasoning is essential. Pellet includes support for OWL 2 profiles including OWL 2 EL. It incorporates optimizations for nominals, conjunctive query answering, and incremental reasoning. Thereâ€™s more detailed information about the architecture of the system and its features in Pellet Help.

An OWL DL reasoner like Pellet is a core component of ontology-based data management applications; if you need expertise in the use of Pellet for advanced integration or analysis applications, Clark & Parsia LLC can help in a variety of roles: consulting, application development, and OEM licensing.
